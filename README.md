# file-server

This code is used for learning purposes. The objective is to create an interface whereby a client can connect to a TCP server and access data from a file server.

## how to use

This code uses netcat for the client input and deals with commands using the server.js file. 

## old versions

client-old.js and input-old.js are previous workings of this code using a different approach. They are no longer in use for the final product.

## bugs to work on

file-server only works for text files at the moment, working on a more elaborate solution that works for different file types (ie. PDF, images, etc.).
